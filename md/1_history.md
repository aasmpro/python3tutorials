## History
Python was conceptualized by __Guido Van Rossum__ in the late __1980s__.

Rossum published the first version of Python code (`0.9.0`) in
February __1991__ at the CWI (Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica) in the
Netherlands , Amsterdam.

Python is derived from __ABC__ programming language, which is a
general-purpose programming language that had been developed at
the CWI.

Rossum chose the name __"Python"__, since he was a big fan of __Monty
Python's Flying Circus__.

Python is now maintained by a core development team at the
institute, although Rossum still holds a vital role in directing
its progress.
