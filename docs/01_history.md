Python was conceptualized by **Guido Van Rossum** in the late **1980s**.

Rossum published the first version of Python code (`0.9.0`) in
February **1991** at the CWI (Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica) in the
Netherlands , Amsterdam.

Python is derived from **ABC** programming language, which is a
general-purpose programming language that had been developed at
the CWI.

Rossum chose the name **"Python"**, since he was a big fan of **Monty Python's Flying Circus**.

Python is now maintained by a core development team at the
institute, although Rossum still holds a vital role in directing
its progress.
